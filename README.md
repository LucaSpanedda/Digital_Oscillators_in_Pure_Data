# Digital Oscillators in Pure Data via different synthesis methods

## table-lookup oscillators [0.00 - 0.99]
Table-lookup synthesis (or Wavetable-lookup synthesis) (Roads 1996) 
is a class of sound synthesis methods using the waveform tables by table-lookup, 
called "table-lookup oscillator" technique. 
The length of waveforms or samples may be varied by each sound synthesis method, 
from a single-cycle up to several minutes.
